## ‚úÖ Your Manual Process

You're using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:

1. Start from node **A**
2. Explore all neighbors of **A** ‚Üí **B, C, D**
3. Then explore children of **B, C, D** in order ‚Üí **E, F, G**
4. As soon as you reach **G**, stop.

This gives the path: **A ‚Üí D ‚Üí G** (shortest in steps).

Your trace table shows **frontier expansion** ‚Äî exactly what BFS does!

## ‚úÖ Python BFS Code (same logic)

Here‚Äôs the code again:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start, goal):
    visited = set()  # To track visited nodes
    queue = deque([[start]])  # Queue stores paths, not just nodes

    while queue:
        path = queue.popleft()       # Get the oldest path (FIFO)
        node = path[-1]              # Look at the last node in this path

        if node == goal:
            return path              # If goal found, return this path

        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)       # Mark this node as visited
            for neighbor in graph[node]:   # Expand neighbors
                new_path = list(path)      # Copy current path
                new_path.append(neighbor)  # Add next node
                queue.append(new_path)     # Push new path to queue
```

## üîç Detailed Explanation

| Line                           | What It Does                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `visited = set()`              | Keeps track of nodes you've already expanded. Avoids loops. |
| `queue = deque([[start]])`     | The BFS queue, initialized with a path: `['A']`.            |
| `while queue:`                 | Loop until there are no more paths to check.                |
| `path = queue.popleft()`       | Gets the **oldest** path from the queue (FIFO behavior).    |
| `node = path[-1]`              | Looks at the last node in the path (current node).          |
| `if node == goal:`             | Checks if we reached goal. If yes, returns the full path.   |
| `visited.add(node)`            | Marks the node as visited.                                  |
| `for neighbor in graph[node]:` | Loops through all direct children of the node.              |
| `new_path = list(path)`        | Copies the current path so we can extend it safely.         |
| `new_path.append(neighbor)`    | Adds the neighbor to this path.                             |
| `queue.append(new_path)`       | Adds the new path to the queue for further exploration.     |

### üß† Example Using Your Graph:

```python
graph_unweighted = {
    'A': ['B', 'C', 'D'],
    'B': ['E', 'F'],
    'C': [],
    'D': ['G'],
    'E': [],
    'F': [],
    'G': []
}
```

### Execution Flow:

* Initial queue: `[['A']]`
* Expand `A` ‚Üí Add paths: `['A', 'B']`, `['A', 'C']`, `['A', 'D']`
* Queue: `[['A', 'B'], ['A', 'C'], ['A', 'D']]`
* Expand `['A', 'B']` ‚Üí Add `['A', 'B', 'E']`, `['A', 'B', 'F']`
* Expand `['A', 'C']` ‚Üí C has no children
* Expand `['A', 'D']` ‚Üí Add `['A', 'D', 'G']` ‚úÖ FOUND GOAL!

## üéØ Conclusion

* Your **manual trace** matches exactly what the **code does**.
* The key idea: BFS explores paths level-by-level and **stores entire paths** so it can return the full route when it finds the goal.
